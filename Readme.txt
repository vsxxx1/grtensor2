## ðŸ›  Installation (Windows)

1. Copy the contents of the `Grtii` folder to a convenient location, e.g.:  
   `C:\Program Files\Maple\Grtii`

2. Edit or create a `maple.ini` file in Maple's home directory and add the following lines:

   ```maple
   libname := "C:/Program Files/Maple/Grtii/lib", libname:
   grlibdir := "C:/Program Files/Maple/Grtii/metrics":
````

3. Launch Maple and load the package:

   ```maple
   with(grtensor);
   ```

   You should see a message confirming that GRTensorII is loaded.

## ðŸ“š Usage

Once the `grtensor` package is loaded, you can begin working with metrics and tensors. Sample use cases can be found in the `worksheets/` directory.

---

## âœ… Verifying Installation

1. Start Maple.
2. Run `with(grtensor);`
3. Load a sample metric and compute a tensor:

   ```maple
   grload("schwarzschild");
   grcalc(R(dn,dn));
   ```

## âš™ Requirements

* Maple 6 (or compatible version)
* Ability to read `.mws`, `.mpl`, and `.m` files
