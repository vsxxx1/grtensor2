Summary of changes since GRTensorII 1.74:
==============================================================================

Release 1.79 (2 February 2001)

  * Important: Converted name of Newman-Penrose Lambda to NPLambda
  * Important: Changed the way indices are handled in diff() within
      grdef() so that grdef(X{a} := diff(phi(r,t), x{^a})): is correct
      (index down on the left, up on the right) whereas before upper
      indices were required to be up on both sides.
  * grdef(): Fixed index checking in operators 
  * grsaveg(): Fixed bug in filename creation
  * grdisplay(): Improved display of super- and sub-scripted indices
  * Modified file read/writes to create OS-independent file names

Release 1.78 (29 September 2000)

  * CRITICAL: Fixed error in Levi-Cevita symbol calculated for a basis
      (Thanks to Chris Hillman for demonstrating this.)
  * Fixed tangle in detg dependency list.
  * Fixed grload() for objects defined with operands.
  * Fixed bug in setting metric name in grsaveobj() components.
  * Fixed text-mode prompts for interactive functions.
  * Various internal clean-ups.
  * Fixed exponent in EL.mpl metric file.

Release 1.77 (14 May 2000)

  * Various internal fixes and Maple6 code-split
  * Fixed readstat() bug in makeg()
  * Fixed bug using grdef() with scalars which was introduced in 1.76,
      as well as improved symmetry recognition for some objects whose
      symfn was not specified.

Release 1.76 (3 November 1999)

  * Fixes to raising indices for n>5
  * Fixes to automatic determination of index symmetries when indices
    are raised/lowered
  * qload() switches to metric if it has already been loaded.
  * Fixes to clearing of definitions via grundef()
  * Added initzero(), setcmpt(), getsym(), setsym() undocumented hacks.
  * New simplification routines
      - expandsqrt() - apply brutal force to simplifying radicals
      - expandtb() - expand numerator and denominator seperately

Release 1.75 (August 1999)

  * Fixes a bug in index ordering in grdisplay() output. (Thanks to
      Jan Gutowski for pointing this out.)
  * Modified user-prompt for interactive functions (eg. makeg()).

Release 1.74 (27 July 1999)

  * Added check for name conflicts in autoAlias().
  * Fixed grtransform() based on source contributed by Edward Huff.
