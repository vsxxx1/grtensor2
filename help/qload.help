HELP FOR: qload

CALLING SEQUENCE:  qload ( fileName ):

      PARAMETERS:  fileName - name of metric or basis file (without the
                              .mpl extension) to be loaded

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SYNOPSIS:

- Reads the metric or basis contained in the file indicated by fileName
  with a .mpl extension.

- Files are read by directories specified in the global variable
  grOptionqloadPath. These directories are searched in order. If the
  file is not found in one of these directories, or the
  grOptionqloadPath is not assigned, the directory specified by
  grOptionMetricPath is searched.

- The metric or basis which is loaded becomes the default spacetime for
  subsequent calculations.

- Metric files can be created using the makeg() command. A number of commonly
  used spacetimes are included in the GRTensorII distribution. An online
  collection is kept at http://astro.queensu.ca/~grtensor/.

- Older metric files do not have an entry specifying the spacetime
  signature. If the global grOptionLLSC variable is set true, then
  the following assumptions are made: if the spacetime is specified
  by a four dimensional metric or general basis, then the signature
  is set to +2; if the spacetime is specified by a set of basis vectors
  satisfying an NP inner product, then the signature is set to -2.
  These assumptions are overridden if the signature is explicitly
  contained in the metric file. If the grOptionLLSC variable is set
  false, then the signature is left unnassigned unless the signature
  is explicitly given by the metric file. See ?groptions for a
  description of the grOptionLLSC variable. To see the signature
  of the current spacetime, use grdisplay(sig).
