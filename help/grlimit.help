HELP FOR: grlimit
===============================================================================

CALLING SEQUENCE:  readlib ( grtools ):
                   grlimit ( expr, var, limit, fnList, valueList, LHlimit ):

      PARAMETERS:  expr      - an expression
                   var       - limiting variable
                   limit     - limiting value of var
                   fnList    - unspecified functions in expr
                   valueList - values of functions and/or their derivitives
                               w.r.t var at the limit point
                   LHlimit   - (optional) limit to number of times L'Hopital's
                               rule should be applied (default = 8)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SYNOPSIS:

- Evaluates expr at the limit point. If indeterminate forms arise then
  L'Hopital's rule is applied (repeatedly) until the limit is resolved
  or LH_limit is exceeded. If LH_limit is exceeded the indeterminate
  portion is returned unevaluated.

- grlimit() works by substitution. It does not determine how rapidly 
  functions approach the limit point.

- Elements of valueList must consist of equations. The left-hand side of the
  equations must be a STRING containing the function at the limit point. 
  Derivitives with respect to the limiting variable by a forward quote (').
  See the example below for details.

- grlimit() first expands the expression and then evaluates term by term.
  divergent terms are then lumped together, factored into a single
  expression and that is then evaluated. This way divergent terms can
  cancel in some cases. If the final result diverges grlimit() returns
  infinity (regardless of whether it's -infinity or not).

- grlimit() is part of the grtools library. Load the library via
  readlib ( grtools ):
