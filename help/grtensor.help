HELP FOR: grtensor()
===============================================================================

- The grtensor() command displays the version of GRTensorII and
  loads any grtensor.ini files found in the directories indicated
  by MapleV's libname variable.

- A grtensor.ini file consists of any number of GRTensorII or MapleV commands.
  For instance, it can be used to automatically load particular libraries or 
  set global defaults such as the groption() variables.


MAPLEV.3:
  Full online help for all GRTensorII commands is available by loading the
  library griihelp. To load this library automatically, add the line

                 readlib ( griihelp ):

  to the grtensor.ini file. [To save memory, these help pages are not loaded 
  by default with GRTensorII.] Ensure that the file griihelp.m is in the
  path specified by the MapleV libname variable.

MAPLEV.4
  Online help is available by placing the file maple.hdb (provided with
  the GRTensorII distribution) in the path specified by the libname
  variable. Unfortunately, the new format of MapleV.4 help screens do not
  allow ASCII files to be displayed in a fixed width font, although
  existing MapleV.3 help pages are entirely in this format. The consequence
  is that the alignment of columns will be distorted in tables
  and also in the examples produced using ASCII versions of MapleV.
  Since we do not have the resources to maintain multiple sets of
  help screens and we do not wish to strand users of MapleV.3 or
  non-windowed MapleV, this will remain a problem for versions of MapleV.4
  that are not backward compatible with ASCII MapleV.3-style help screens.
  The ASCII source for the GRTensorII help screens is available from
  the World Wide Web page referenced below.
