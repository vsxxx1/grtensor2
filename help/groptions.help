CALLING SEQUENCE:  groptions():

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SYNOPSIS:

- This function displays the values of global variables controlling the
  GRTensorII environment.

- The values can be altered by re-assignment within the MapleV session.
  Alternatively, the re-assignment can be placed in the default grtensor.ini
  file so that they are set when GRTensorII is initialized by the grtensor()
  command [see the ?grtensor help page for a description of the grtensor.ini
  file].

The following variables control GRTensorII options:

grOptionAlterSize (boolean, default = false)
  If true, the new size of each component is displayed when gralter() is
  invoked..

grOptionCoordNames (boolean, default = true)
  If true then tensor indices are displayed as the coordinate name. 
  If false then indices are displayed by coordinate number.

grOptionDefaultSimp (integer or name, default = normal)
  This variable controls the type of simplification called during the 
  calculation of an object by the grcalc() command. The default is to use 
  the Maple routine normal(). Default simp must be set to one of:

     simplify, trig, power, hypergeom, radical, expand, factor,
     normal, sort, sqrt, trigsin, cons, consr

  [See ?gralter for details on simplification names.]

  [In general, it is recommended that gralter() be used when simplification
  becomes necessary rather than changing the global simplification via
  this variable, as it is unlikely that any particular choice will work
  well in general situations, and an incorrect choice can greatly increase
  calculation times.]

grOptionDisplayLimit (integer, default = 5000)
  This integer variable controls the size threshold beyond which an object
  will not be displayed. If the object exceeds this limit only its
  size is displayed. `Size' is determined by the MapleV length() function
  which estimates the number of words used by the object.

grOptionLLSC (boolean, default = true)
  This variable indicates whether the Landau-Lifshitz spacelike
  signature convention is to be assumed on loading and defining new
  spacetimes.  If set to true, then four dimensional spacetimes
  specified by a metric, g(dn,dn), or a general basis for which the
  signature has not been explicitly given, are assumed to 1have
  signature +2 (where signature is defined as the number of positive
  metric components minus the number of negative metric components in a
  locally orthonormal basis). Bases satisfying an NP inner product are
  assumed to have signature -2. If the grOptionLLSC variable is set to
  false, then the sig object will not be assigned unless it is
  explicitly given by the spacetime input file or specified in makeg().

grOptionMetricPath (string, default=homedir)
  This option variable is a MapleV string which specifies the default
  directory from which metric files are to be loaded or to which they will
  be saved. The sub-directory names should be seperated using forward slash,
  '/', even on MS-DOS/Windows systems. 

grOptionqloadPath (sequence, default=unassigned)
  This option variable can be used to specify a set of directories which
  will be searched by qload() when loading metrics. Individual directory
  names are listed as MapleV strings with sub-directories seperated by the
  forward slash character, '/'. Directories are searched in the order in
  which they are listed. If this variable is left unassigned or if the metric
  file is not found in any of the listed directories, then the directory
  specified in grOptionMetricPath is searched.

grOptionTermSize (integer, default=100)
  This variable effects the display of vectors and matrices. If the size
  of individual components of a 1- or 2-index tensor are smaller than this
  value (measured in MapleV words), then the object will appear in matrix
  form when displayed using grdisplay(). If terms are larger than the value
  of this variable, components are listed individually as they are for
  tensors with 3+ indices. By setting this variable to some very high value
  the matrix form of display can be assured, while setting this value to
  zero will prevent matrix-type display.

grOptionTrace (boolean, default = true)
  If set to true, the names of objects calculated during the
  the execution of grcalc() or grcalcalter() will be printed as they
  are computed.

grOptionVerbose (boolean, default = false)
  If true, a message is displayed as each component of an object is
  calculated using the grcalc() or grcalcalter() commands.

grOptionWindows (boolean, default = true) 
  If true, this variable selects the `Windows' display routine. 
  If false, a text based display routine. These options affect how
  indices appear in objects displayed using grdisplay().


To change an option variable, assign it a new value. For example,

  > grOptionDisplayLimit := 2500;

will change the value of the display limit to 2500.

Changing the variables to the wrong type of value (e.g assigning an integer
value to a variable that is intended to be boolean) will result in errors 
or unspecified operation.
