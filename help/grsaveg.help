HELP FOR: grsaveg

CALLING SEQUENCE:  grsaveg ( savename, metricpath ):

      PARAMETERS:  savename   - the name of the file (without the `.mpl'
                                extension) in which the metric or basis is to
                                be saved.
                   metricpath - (optional) the directory in which the file
                                is to be saved. If this value is not
                                specified, the directory given by the
                                global varialbe grOptionMetricPath is used.
                                The directory should be specified in the form
                                of a MapleV string with forward slashes, '/',
                                seperating sub-directories.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SYNOPSIS:

- Saves the information specifying a metric or basis.

- The current default spacetime is saved to the file specified by the
  savename parameter with `.mpl' appended, in the directory specified
  by the global variable grOptionMetricPath or the metricpath
  parameter, if specified.

- Information saved includes:

         coordinates, x(up),
         metric components, g(dn,dn), [if the spacetime is specified via
                                       a metric]
         basis components, e(bdn,up) and/or e(bdn,dn), [if any]
         constraint equations, constraint [if any]
         text description, Info [if any]

- If the current default spacetime has both a  metric and basis calculated
  for it (for instance, if a basis was loaded and the metric calculated,
  or a tetrad calculated from a metric using nptetrad()), a prompt asks
  which objects are to be saved.

- If both covariant and contravariant components of a basis are defined,
  a prompt asks which are to be saved.

- NOTE: MapleV.3 does not check for the existence of files before it
  performs the write operation. Thus if a metric file already exists 
  with the specified name, it will be overwritten.

EXAMPLE:

> qload ( schw ):

> nptetrad ( [ 0, 0, 0, 1] ):

> grsaveg ( npschw2 ):

Would you like to save 1) the metric [g(dn,dn)], or
                       2) the basis vectors?
