HELP FOR: Killing Operators and Functions
===============================================================================
SYNOPSIS:

- The operator KillingTest[] can be used to test if a vector is a Killing 
  or homothetic Killing vector. It takes as its argument the name of a 
  vector (a single index GRTensorII object). For example:

    > grcalc ( KillingTest[v] );

  Displaying the result of this calculation (using grdisplay()) will indicate
  if the vector was determined to be a Killing vector.

  A Killing vector, k , is defined to be a vector which satisfies the
  equation:

             k    + k    -  2 Phi g   = 0 .                         (1)
              a;b    b;a           ab

  If Phi = 0, the vector is a proper Killing vector (or simply Killing 
    vector);

  If Phi = constant, the vector is called `homothetic'; and

  If Phi is a general function of the coordinates then the vector is
    a `conformal' Killing vector.
                                          a
  ( In general Phi = Expansion(k)/ndim = k   /ndim )
                                           ;a

- NOTE: The determination of whether or not a vector is a Killing vector
  requires that Eq (1) holds. The left-hand side of this equation is
  stored in the GRTensorII object ktest[v](dn,dn). In order to ensure
  that the algorithm work properly, it is necessary to ensure that
  this object is simplified as much as possible using gralter().

  The conformal factor is stored in the GRTensorII object conf[v], and
  if this can not be evaluated to zero the vector is labelled as a
  conformal/homothetic Killing vector rather than a Killing vector.
  Thus it is important that this object also be simplified as much as
  possible before using KillingTest.

  If upon examining ktest[v](dn,dn) and conf[v] it is found that these
  objects have not been completely simplified, then use

  > grclear ( KillingTest[v] ):

  to clear the results of the KillingTest[] calculation, then apply
  the necessary simplifications to conf[v] and ktest[v](dn,dn) using
  gralter(), then calculate KillingTest[v] again using grcalc().

- The function KillingCoords() exists to create coordinate vectors and then
  check which (if any) are Killing vectors. It does not take any arguments.

> qload ( schw ):
> grdef ( `v{^a} := kdelta( x{^a}, t)` ):
Created definition for v(up)

> grcalc ( KillingTest[v] ):
                                CPU Time  = .850

> grdisplay ( KillingTest[v] ):

                               Killing Test Result

                              For the schw metric.

                     Killing Test = v is a Killing vector.

                        Killing Coordinate Test Results

                    Coordinate vector  = [r, theta, phi, t]

           coord1(up) = [1, 0, 0, 0], coord1 is NOT a Killing vector.

           coord2(up) = [0, 1, 0, 0], coord2 is NOT a Killing vector.

             coord3(up) = [0, 0, 1, 0], coord3 is a Killing vector.

             coord4(up) = [0, 0, 0, 1], coord4 is a Killing vector.
