HELP FOR: grloadobj
===============================================================================

CALLING SEQUENCE:  grloadobj ( metric, fileName )

      PARAMETERS:  metric   - metric (or basis) name into which the components
                              are to be loaded.
                   fileName - file name (string)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SYNOPSIS:

- The components of a GRTensorII object which has been saved with grsaveobj()
  can be loaded into MapleV with this command. Thus one can avoid carrying
  out long calculations multiple times by saving their results to a file and
  re-loading them in later sessions.

- Components are saved in a spacetime independent form and can be loaded 
  into any spacetime which is specified by the metric parameter. Subsequent
  calculations will be carried out as if the loaded tensor had actually
  been calculated for the given spacetime.

  Note, this can cause nonsensical results if the objects which are loaded
  do not correspond to those that would normally be calculated for the
  particular metric.

- The specified metric must have been previously loaded into GRTensorII using 
  grload() or qload().

EXAMPLE:

> qload ( bondi ):
> grcalc ( R(dn,dn), R(dn,dn,dn,dn) ):
> grsaveobj ( R(dn,dn), R(dn,dn,dn,dn), `bondi.cmpnts` ):

For the bondi metric
Saved to bondi.cmpts

> restart:
> readlib ( grii ):
> qload ( bondi ):
> grloadobj ( bondi, `bondi.cmpnts` ):

Object R(dn,dn) loaded.
Object R(dn,dn,dn,dn) loaded.
Done.
