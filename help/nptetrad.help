CALLING SEQUENCE:  nptetrad ( [lnSpace] )

      PARAMETERS:  lnSpace -- (optional) specifies a pair of coordinates
                              whose corresponding 1-forms will be used
                              to construct the l and n vectors of the
                              tetrad, eg. [t,r].

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SYNOPSIS:

- The nptetrad() command finds a null NP tetrad corresponding to a
  given metric, g(dn,dn). The forms are saved as the object e(bdn,dn).

- Basis vectors are initially chosen as column vectors of the covariant
  metric. From these vectors, an orthonormalization is carried out to
  create a set of null vectors that satisfy the NP inner product,

                       c    [  0,  1,  0,  0  ]
              e     e     = [  1,  0,  0,  0  ].
               (a)c  (b)    [  0,  0,  0, -1  ]
                            [  0,  0, -1,  0  ]

- If the optional `lnSpace' argument is supplied, then the 1-forms
  corresponding to the given columns of g(dn,dn) are use preferentially
  to construct the l and n vectors. The `lnSpace' argument is specified
  as a MapleV list of two coordinate names (eg. [t,r]), or numbers
  (eg. [4,1]). At least one of these coordinates should be timelike or
  null.

- Because of inconsistencies in MapleV's application of the imaginary
  number I=sqrt{-1} in symbolic expressions, incorrectly formed tetrads can
  result. The output of an nptetrad() operation should be checked as
  follows:

    - the vectors l and n should have no imaginary components
       (l and n correspond to the first and second rows of e(bdn,dn),
       respectively).
    - the vectors m and mbar should be complex conjugates of each other
       (m and mbar correspond to the third and fourth rows of e(bdn,dn),
       respectively).
    - the inner product eta(bup,bup) should be of the NP form given above.

  If any of these criteria can not be met, then the session should be
  restarted and nptetrad() run again, possibly with a different choice
  of lnSpace argument. [Note, the location of I in MapleV expressions
  is strongly dependent on MapleV's memory state which can vary from
  one run to the next. Thus different tetrads can result between two runs
  of nptetrad() even if the input is identical.]

- The appearance of large terms in the components of the basis can
  impair later calculations. To ensure that future calculations are
  optimized, apply the relevant gralter() commands to the basis
  vectors until they seem to be fully simplified. See ?gralter.

- The implementation of the Newman-Penrose formalism in GRTensorII
  follows the original specification of Newman and Penrose (1962).
  As such, it requires that the spacetime have a -2 signature. If
  this is not the case, the program will ask the user if the metric
  signature is to be reversed in the creation of the tetrad. If the
  user answers `no' to this prompt, the tetrad can not be created and
  the program aborts. A `yes' answer will cause the signature of
  g(dn,dn) and g(up,up) to be negated.

- Tetrads created using nptetrad() can be saved using the grsaveg()
  command.

- The results of the calculation are placed in the GRTensorII objects
  e(bdn,dn) and eta(bup,bup), the basis vectors and basis inner product,
  respectively.
