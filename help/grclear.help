HELP FOR: grclear

CALLING SEQUENCE:  grclear ( objects ):

      PARAMETERS: objects -  GRTensorII object name or sequence of names.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SYNOPSIS:

- Deletes the record of the GRTensorII objects named, allowing them
  to be re-calculated for a particular metric.

- If the name `results' is given as the `objects' parameter, then all
  of the tensors calculated for the default spacetime will be deleted, but
  not the spacetime itself.

- If the name `metric' is given as the `objects' parameter, then all
  of the tensors calculated for the default spacetime will be deleted,
  including the components of the metric, g(dn,dn). If basis vectors
  exists for the spacetime, they are not cleared.

- If the name `spacetime' is given as the `objects' parameter, then
  all of the objects calclulated for the default spacetime will be
  deleted, including the components of the metric and basis, if
  assigned.

- If `metric' or `results' is specified then grclear() prompts for
  confirmation and allows user to abort if so desired.

- grclear() does not remove the definition of the object, merely its
  value. To clear a definition use grundefine().
