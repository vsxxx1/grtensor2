CALLING SEQUENCE:  PetrovReport():

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SYNOPSIS:

- Generates a report detailing how the determination of the Petrov type
  of a spacetime was carried out.

- The object Petrov (calculated for null tetrads using grcalc) is determined
  using an algorithm detailed in

  Letniowski, F. W., and McLenaghan, R. G., 1988, Gen. Rel. Grav., 20,
    463-83.

  The notation of this paper is used by PetrovReport() in referring to
  intermediate variables.

  The success of the algorithm depends on determining whether certain 
  functions of the Weyl scalars can be evaluated to zero. It is sometimes
  the case that the computer can not simplify an expression which, upon
  inspection, is clearly equal to zero. In these rare cases, the Petrov
  algorithm will fail in that it will report a Petrov type which is more
  complex than the true value. Using the report command, the intermediate
  steps taken in determination of the Petrov type can be examined and
  evaluated for correctness.

                  The conclusion 'Petrov type = D (or simpler)'

                               for the schw metric

                       was based on the following results:

                              Weyl scalar Psi0 = 0

                              Weyl scalar Psi1 = 0

                Weyl scalar Psi2 could not be evaluated to zero.

                              Weyl scalar Psi3 = 0

                              Weyl scalar Psi4 = 0

               ---> Therefore the metric is Petrov D (or simpler).
